**Summer 2024, Pre-Assignment**

**Part 2: Data Manipulation (1)**

1.  **Preparation**: Like the first RMarkdown, we ask you to follow this RStudio
    primer before starting this RMarkdown. We strongly recommend taking notes
    below and typing in the code yourself as you follow this tutorial.

```{r}
# INSTALLATION CODE:

# Please run this code first. It may take a minute to download the data
# It's okay that this code looks mysterious for now, 
# it is here to handle installation for you in the background.
# It will make more sense soon!

if(!("tidyverse" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) {
  install.packages("tidyverse")
}

cat("tidyverse ready", "\n")

if(!("babynames" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) {
  install.packages("babynames")
}

cat("babynames ready", "\n")

```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# If needed: 
# TAKE NOTES HERE for the Primers
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)
```

As usual, once you have completed the RStudio tutorials above please start here
and continue the document below. These exercises give you additional
opportunities to practice the most important concepts from the RStudio Tutorials
for our HKS courses.

# Vectors

In RMarkdown 1, we learned about objects. Vectors are objects with multiple
values. For example, you could have vectors that tell you the `population` and
`year` for a particular area. Like this:

```{r}
pop <- c(100, 347, 500)
year <- c(2019, 2020, 2021)
```

You can type the name of the object to see these values and also use functions
on them just like before:

```{r}
# Make sure to run the previous code first to create these objects
pop 
year 
mean(pop) 
```

However, what if you want information on population **and** year **in a single
object**? This is what **datasets** are for.

# 1. Datasets

A **dataset** will store multiple pieces of information for each
**observation**. An **observation** can be any individual thing you want to
study - a country, a person, a book, etc. The concept is very similar to a
spreadsheet in a program like Excel or a programming language Stata, where
observations are the rows and columns are variables.

For example, let's use one of the datasets built into the `tidyverse()` package.
Load the `tidyverse` package with `library(tidyverse)`. You will need to do this
at the start of any script where you want to use `tidyverse`.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

The `tidyverse` package comes with a built-in dataset called `population`. This
*object* called `population` was automatically created when you ran
`library(tidyverse)`. Go to the console in Posit Cloud (or RStudio) (the panel
called "Console" with the `>` character at the bottom) and type `population`. It
will print out a dataset that looks like this:

```{r}
population
```

Notice that this dataset has both *rows* and *columns*. `4060 x 3` tells you
that there are 4060 rows (up to down) and 3 columns (left to right). We can see
the first ten rows in the screenshot above. Each row in the dataset tells you
about the `population` of a `country` in a particular `year`. So, the population
of Afghanistan in 2003 was 23,116,142.

In the console, type `head(population)` to look at the top of your dataset,
since the entire dataset is large. It is a good idea to always look through your
datasets:

Notice one strange thing: here, we have an object called `population` and a
column called `population`. We will keep that in mind as we progress!

```{r}
# Want to print out a different number of rows than 6?
# Try using an argument called "n" in the head function...

head(population) 
```

You can do many things with datasets. Often, we will want to use functions on
datasets. For example, the `slice()` function takes two arguments, an object and
a number `n`, and the function will return to you the first `n` rows you asked
for.

For example, to have R return only the 5th row of `population`, type:

```{r}
slice(population, 5) 
```

You can also pass a vector to `slice()` to have it return multiple rows. For
example, to have `slice()` return rows 2, 3, and 4, we can write: `2:4`.

```{r}
# The : syntax creates a vector from the low to the high number
2:4 
```

```{r}
# If we pass this into slice(), we get each row back 
slice(population, 2:4)
```

# 2. The `|>` Operator (or %\>%)

We will often want to chain multiple functions together. The `|>` operator
(called "pipe") makes this very easy.

The `|>` operator passes the object on the left **as the first argument** to the
function on the right. For example, **both of these lines do the exact same
thing**:

```{r}
# Call the slice function on the population object
  # here, population is the first argument
slice(population, 5)

# Call the slice function on the population object with |>
# population is still the first argument, passed by the |>
population |> slice(5)
```

# Exercises #1

1.  Write code to find the first 10 rows of `population`. Save it in an object
    called `first_ten`.

```{r}
# Write your code here
slice(population, 10)

# Or using pipes
population %>% slice(10) # If you loaded the tidyerse or
population |> slice(10)

```

2.  Try to run `population + 1`. What happens? That's an error message - read
    it! Most importantly, why isn't this working? What is the message trying to
    tell you?

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Write your code here 
population + 1
```

Write your text response here:

You can't add number to a whole dataset, have to pick a single numeric column
(e.g. population\$population +1)

# 3. Choosing particular rows: `filter()`

You can use many functions to interact with datasets too. You will often want to
work with only observations that meet a certain condition. For example, only
countries in a particular year, or only people in a study over the age of 45, or
only people with more than 12 years of schooling

`filter()` makes a smaller dataset from a larger dataset by subsetting to rows
that meet certain criteria that you specify. The function `filter()` will return
every **row** in a particular dataset that meets a certain condition. For
example, the `population` dataset has many countries in it. What if you only
want the values from France? You can use `filter()` to choose observations that
only have "France" as the value for `country`.

`filter()` will evaluate the condition in the parentheses to `TRUE` or `FALSE`
for every single row in the dataset. The function will return only rows which
evaluate to `TRUE`. Do you remember Booleans from Notebook #1? This is one
reason why they are so useful!

```{r}
# Return rows for which country is equal to France
population |> filter(country == "France") 
```

Keep in mind, you can also get the same results by using the following code
style:

```{r}
population |>
  filter(country == "France")
```

When checking equality with operators like `==`, R is very specific and
case-sensitive. That is, "France" is not equal to "france," or "FRANCE."

Notice that you absolutely need two equal signs here, for `==`, and not `=`.
Using one equals sign when you need two to check equality (in functions like
`filter()`) is a very common coding error!

```{r}
country <- "France"

country == "france"
country == "FRANCE"
country == "FRA"
```

Because these are not equal, when using `filter()` you need to be precise and
make sure your comparisons reflect the values in your actual data. For example,
this code would not return any rows because no rows in our dataset have country
equal to "FRANCE":

```{r}
population |> filter(country == "FRANCE") 
```

R returned an empty dataset. This is not a problem with R, since it is doing
exactly what we asked it to do -- return any rows with "FRANCE" in the country
column. However, because there were no such rows, we get an empty tibble (0 rows
by 3 columns).

To look at the unique values of a particular column, you can use the `unique()`
function. The way to ask for a particular column is to put the `$` operator
after the name of the dataset, like this example below:

```{r}
# Show all unique values of the country column in the population object
unique(population$country)
```

Notice that FRANCE is not in there, but France is. When using `filter()`, we
could target any one of these values above. More broadly, we can `filter()` on
any condition that evaluates to `TRUE` or `FALSE`. For example, let's get data
from the year 1995.

```{r}
population |> filter(year == 1995)
```

Finally, it is often useful to use **multiple** logical conditions at once. For
example, return rows in France AND in the year 1995, or return any data from
France OR India.

-   `&` is the AND operator. Both conditions must be `TRUE` to return a row.
-   `|` is the OR operator. Either condition can be `TRUE` to return a row.

```{r}
# Return rows from France AND in the year 1995
population |> filter(country == "France" & year == 1995)
```

```{r}
# Return rows from France OR India
population |> filter(country == "France" | country == "India")
```

# Ordering Data

Often, we want to **order** or **sort** our dataset by one of the values in our
data. This is done with the `arrange()` function.

By default, `arrange()` will order from smallest to largest for the column name
you enter:

```{r}
tuvalu <- population |> filter(country == "Tuvalu")

tuvalu |> arrange(population)
```

By including the `desc()` (descending) function inside of `arrange()`, you can
have it sort from largest to smallest.

For example, this code shows us that the population of Tuvalu keeps increasing
over time.

```{r}
tuvalu |> arrange(desc(population))
```

# Exercise #2

1.  Use `filter()` to extract the rows in `population` in the year 1999.

```{r}
# Write your code here
population |>
  filter(year == 1999)
  
```

2.  Use `filter()` to extract the rows in `population` with less than 5000
    people. Assign the result to an object called `small_countries`.

```{r}
# Write your code here
small_countries <- population |> 
 filter(population < 5000)
```

3.  Use `filter()` to extract the rows in `population` for every country
    **other** than Greece. **Hint**: remember in Part 1 we talked about a way to
    check if one value is NOT equal to another value.

```{r}
# Write your code here
population |> 
  filter(country != "Greece")
```

4.  Use `filter()` to create an object with only the rows from 2004. Then, use
    `filter()` on that object to get only the rows from India OR Pakistan.

```{r}
# Write your code here
# option #1: separate calls with %in% -- This uses the c() operators for vectors.
population |>
  filter(year == 2004) |>
  filter(country %in% c("India", "Pakistan"))

# option #2: separate calls with |
population |>
  filter(year == 2004) |>
  filter(country == "India" | country == "Pakistan")

# option #3: single call with %in%
population |>
  filter(year == 2004 & country %in% c("India", "Pakistan"))

# option #4: single call with |
population |>
  filter(year == 2004 & (country == "India" | country == "Pakistan"))

# final: onject first with only 2004 and then the filter
only_2004 <- population |>
  filter(year == 2004)

only_2004 |>
  filter(country %in% c("India", "Pakistan"))
```

# 4. Creating new columns: `mutate()`

The `mutate()` function is used to **make new columns** in your data. For
example, if we wanted a new column in our dataset representing countries with at
least 10 million people in a given year:

```{r}
# remember: population is the name of the dataset
# but also the name of a column in the dataset
population |>
  mutate(ten_million = population > 10000000)
```

In order to keep changes in your dataset object, you will need create a new
object just like always. That is, functions like `mutate()` and `filter()` will
create output for you, but will not save these results to a new object unless
you manually ask it to by creating a new object with `<-`.

For example, let's try to use the `ten_million` column we just used to filter to
observations where it equals `TRUE`:

```{r, error = TRUE}
# this will give you an error! 
population |> 
  filter(ten_million == TRUE)
```

Why does this code not work? We edited the `population` object to have a new
`ten_million` column, but we never saved it back in a new object. For example,
this code would work with no errors:

```{r}
# create a new object with a ten_million column
pop_million <- population |>
  mutate(ten_million = population > 10000000)

pop_million |>
  filter(ten_million == TRUE)
```

In general, the best practice is to write your code, make sure it is making the
changes you want to your dataset, and then save it back to an object as the last
step. However, make sure whether or not you would like to overwrite your object.
Sometimes it might be better just to save your manipulated data into a new
object.

```{r}
population <- population |>
  mutate(ten_million = population > 10000000)

head(population)
```

You can make new columns to accomplish all sorts of tasks. For example, beyond
checking logical statements we can do mathematical operations on an existing
column:

```{r}
population |>
    mutate(pop_in_thousands = population / 1000)
```

# Exercise #3

1.  Filter `population` to the data for years since 2005. Save it to an object
    called `modern`.

```{r}
# Write your code here
modern <- population |> 
  filter(year > 2005)
```

2.  Create a column in `population` called `is2000` that is `TRUE` if the year
    is 2000 and `FALSE` otherwise. After you've confirmed your code is working,
    don't forget to save your changes back into the `population` object.

```{r}
# Write your code here
population <- population |>
  mutate(is2000 = year == 2000)
```

# 5. Using your own datasets

You can also download and use your own datasets in R, and we do not have to
exclusively work with pre-built datasets like `babynames`. R can work with a ton
of formats you may have seen in the past (.csv, .pdf, .xlsx, etc.). We will
download a CSV from the internet and read it into R. During Math Camp, we will
practice loading datasets that you have stored locally on your own computer
(like an Excel spreadsheet) into R.

To explore this, we are going to use data on US presidential election results
for every state from 1932-2016.

Then, we are going to use the `read_csv()` function to read this dataset. We
will store it in an object called `elections`. The argument to this function is
the path to the file you want to read. Since you placed it in the same folder,
the path is simply the name of the file. After typing the quotes, you can press
the **tab** key on your keyboard to show your list of options. If you press tab
again, R will autocomplete.

```{r}
# Reminder: please make sure to run library(tidyverse) code above before running this line
# read_csv() is from the tidyverse package
elections <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/lhp9nets5qb2rhe/presidential_elections.csv?dl=1")
```

# Exercise #4

1.  Look at the `elections` dataset with `head()`. What do the rows and columns
    represent?

```{r}
# Write your code here
head(elections)
```

2.  Use `filter()` to subset results for Massachussetts and store the answer in
    an object called `ma`.

```{r}
# Write your code here
ma <- elections |> 
  filter(state == "Massachusetts")
```

3.  Use `filter()` to make an object called `south` that only contains results
    from states in the south:

```{r}
# Write your code here
south <- elections |>
  filter(region == "South")
```

4.  Look up the function `nrow()` in the documentation (you can type `?nrow` or
    Google "r nrow"). Figure out what it does, and then use it on both `ma` and
    `south`.

```{r}
# Write your code here
nrow(ma)
nrow(south)
```

5.  Explain why thie following code returns no rows (it may be helpful to look
    at the dataset with `elections`):

```{r, error = TRUE}
elections |> filter(state == "MA")
```

Write your answer here:

The `state` column does not have abbreviations like that, the words are fully
spelled out. R needs exact strings to match in order for the `filter()` to work.
