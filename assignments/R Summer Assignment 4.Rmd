**Summer 2024, Pre-Assignment**

**Notebook 4: Data Manipulation: Part 2**

The instructions are the same as the first RMarkdown, with a new tutorial link
to watch. Please make a copy of this notebook, watch the tutorial, complete this
document, and submit the URL to your notebook on Canvas.

1.  **Creation**: First, you do not need to make a personal copy of this
    notebook. We encourage you to use the Posit Cloud and, if needed, download
    the project file if you would like to use it offline from your Posit Cloud
    home page.

2.  **Preparation**: Please complete these official RStudio tutorials before
    starting this notebook. We strongly recommend taking notes below and typing
    in the code yourself as you follow this tutorial.

-   **WATCH**:
    -   [dplyr essentials](https://youtu.be/Gvhkp-Yw65U)
    -   [dplyr advanced guide](https://youtu.be/DiY8EqZDwoI) (Optional)

This one has several parts, but each part is fairly short. We ask you to
complete them before continuing with the rest of this notebook. There are
several parts this time, so these may take a while. Feel free to complete some
and then come back later.

3.  **Submission**: Complete your assignment in the Posit Cloud environment.
    Please submit only the file you are working on (i.e., your RMarkdown) to
    [this Assignment
    Link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/z6jRaakfgr9NwGnLonPR). Remember to add
    your name to line 3 of this file.

## Remember: General RMardown Tips

## General Tips

You can enter R code in the code chunks below. To run code, you can click the
play button that appears on the left side of the code chunk when your cursor is
in the box, or press CMD + Enter (or Return) on a Mac, or CTRL + Enter on a PC.

We strongly encourage you to practice writing code as you learn -- do not just
read this document and only complete the exercises. Please write and enter your
own code while you read. Try new things, type code in, and see what happens.
Code as you go. Coding is a skill, much like learning to play an instrument. The
most important part of learning to code is to **practice**!

Remember to save your work frequently. In Posit Cloud, you can save your
notebook by going to File â†’ Save, or with CMD + S (Mac) / Ctrl + S (PC). This
will create a personal copy of the notebook for you to work from.

**Please save often.** While Posit Cloud does autosave, it's a good habit to
manually save your work regularly to ensure you don't lose any progress.

If you get stuck in any aspect of using these Posit Cloud RMarkdowns, please use
Slack to ask the teaching team.

# 1. When to summarize?

Often, we will want to **aggregate** information across a dataset or across
groups in a dataset. For example, adding the total number of votes in every
polling place, or the average outcome in each group in a randomized trial. Using
our `state` population data from last time, imagine we wanted to plot the total
US population over time.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# INSTALLATION CODE:

if(!("tidyverse" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) {
  install.packages("tidyverse")
}

library(tidyverse)

# This code sets some plot options,
# it will make more sense later in the semester.
options(repr.plot.width=10, repr.plot.height=10)
theme_set(theme_gray(base_size = 15))
theme_set(theme_dark(base_size = 15))
theme_set(theme_linedraw(base_size = 20))
update_geom_defaults("point",list(size=5))
update_geom_defaults("line",list(lwd=1.5))

# read in the data
state <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/javbnd4c3n67380/state_population.csv?dl=1")

# see the first 5 rows of the data
head(state)

cat("Done!")

```

We could plot every state at once, but this would not tell us the total US
population by year. Since the rows in our dataset are state populations in one
particular year, this plot will plot every state as its own sequence of points
in a scatterplot.

```{r}
state |>
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = year, 
      y = population
    )
  ) +
  geom_point()
```

What if we want to know the **total population by year**? We already have the
tools we need to do this for a single year.

How? We could `filter()` the dataset to a certain year, and then use `sum()` on
the `population` column. We can use the `$` syntax after the name of a dataset
to access one particular column in the dataset as a vector.

For example, to calculate the US population in 1976, we could:

```{r}
# Filter rows to all observations in 1976
all_1976 <- state |> 
  filter(year == 1976)

# Sum the population column
sum(all_1976$population)
```

So, according to this dataset the US population in 1976 was a little over 200
million.

# Quick Exercise

First, try it yourself. Try calculating the population of only the US South in
the year 1980.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

# group_by() and summarise()

The above process was a little tedious though. How might we calculate this total
for **every year** in our dataset? We could replicate the above procedure many
times, or perhaps create a function and run it once for each year.

Instead, R makes this sort of repetition with the functions `group_by()` and
`summarise()`. When used together, `group_by()` defines a group and
`summarise()` will perform a calculation within each of those groups. If you are
familiar with Excel, this idea is conceptually similar to a Pivot Table. You
will see that R allows for much more flexible and complex calculations.

For example, this code will run the `sum()` function on the `population` column
within each group (`year`):

```{r}
# Within each group (year)
# calculate the total population
pop_by_year <- state |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarise(pop = sum(population))

# tail() shows the final rows in the dataset
head(pop_by_year)
```

Now that we have that object, we can plot total US population by year directly.
How should we visualize this data? Building on what we learned in our last
lesson, we have a lot of options. Let's start a simple bar plot:

```{r}
# simple bar plot
pop_by_year |>
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = year, 
      y = pop
    )
  ) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Population",
    title = "US Population by Year"
  )
```

Another option would be to try to draw the viewer's attention to the top of the
bar by placing points on top. These are often called 'lollipop plots,' and can
be made by creating a line segment and a `geom_point()`.

Want to learn more about the `geom_segment()` function? One very useful skill
when learning to program is learning to read documentation. Take a look at [this
help page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_segment.html) for the
`geom_segment()` function and try to read through what each argument below does.

```{r}
# a "lollipop" plot
# combines straight line segment with point
pop_by_year |>
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = year, 
      y = pop
    )
  ) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = year, xend = year, y = 0, yend = pop), col = "grey") +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Population",
    title = "US Population by Year"
  )
```

You can also **define groups by multiple variables**. This is useful when you
want to calculate a particular statistic within groups defined by more than one
variable. For example, to calculate population separately by **region** AND
**year**.

```{r}
region_year <- state |>
  group_by(region, year) |> # group_by multiple columns
  summarise(pop = sum(population))

region_year |> filter(year == 1900)
```

Now, we could use a facet like we learned in the previous lesson to visualize
the growth in each region at once.

```{r}
region_year |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = pop)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = year, xend = year, y = 0, yend = pop), col = "grey") +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Population",
       title = "US Population by Year") +
  facet_wrap(~region)
```

## Exercises #1

This dataset contains information on World Cup matches from 1930 to 2006. The
`scored` column contains information on each national team's performance in a
particular World Cup.

```{r}
cups <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/eb74w6516hvm11a/world_cups%20-%20WorldCups.csv?dl=1")
```

1.  Look at the data with a function like `head()`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

2.  Then, using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, calculate the total number of
    goals that each team has scored across all World Cups. Save this to an
    object named `goals`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

3.  Filter to only teams that have scored at least 50 goals in total from the
    `goals` object. Save this in an object called `high_score_teams`.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

4.  Design a plot visualizing the number of goals scored by each team using
    `high_score_teams`. The plot can be as simple (or as sophisticated) as you
    want as long as it conveys clearly the main findings you want the reader to
    derive.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

# Using groups for other statistics

The sum is one interesting measurement you will want to calculate, but it is
certainly not the only one. The **mean** (average) is another. Thankfully,
calculating means for the complete sample or finding means within each group is
very simple. All you need to do is change the function that you use in
`summarise()`.

Take a look at the examples below. We recommend running each section of code
separately and trying to edit them yourself. Calculate other statistics you
think might be interesting. Any questions or trouble? Post in the Slack!

```{r}
# find total number of goals scored for each team
cups |>
  group_by(team) |>
  summarise(scored = sum(scored))
```

```{r}
# find average number of goals scored by team in each World Cup
# consider: why might a statistic like this not be very useful for all teams?
cups |>
  group_by(team) |>
  summarise(scored = mean(scored))
```

Using `summarise()` without any groups created by `group_by()` before it will
summarize the entire dataset. For example:

```{r}
# find total number of goals scored in 1930 World Cup
cups |>
  filter(year == 1930) |>
  summarise(scored = sum(scored))
```

```{r}
# find average goals scored per match in 1930 World Cup
cups |>
  filter(year == 1930) |>
  summarise(scored = mean(scored / matches))
```

The **median** of a set of numbers is found by ordering them from smallest to
largest and finding the value in the middle. Means and medians are both ways of
estimating the center of a dataset, but they do have important differences in
some cases. For example:

```{r}
numbers <- c(1, 3, 7, 9, 2000)
# notice how the mean is sensitive to outliers
mean(numbers)
# the median is not as sensitive
median(numbers)
```

```{r}
# consider: why might these numbers be different?
mean(cups$scored)
median(cups$scored)
```

# 2. Visualizing distributions

Statistics like sums, means, and medians are one way of summarizing data, but
they still only tell you one number. Sometimes, you will want to visualize all
of the values in a column or two of your dataset - the entire **distribution**.

### Histograms

For example, a **histogram** will visualize all of the values in one column.
Taller bars tell you that more data fit in that range:

```{r}
# visualize shots on goal since 1950
cups |>
  filter(year > 1950) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = shots_on_goal)) +
    geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
# just like any other geom, can use with groups and facets
cups |>
  filter(year > 1950) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = shots_on_goal)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    facet_wrap(~year)
```

This tells you that most teams had between 0-10 shots on goal, while some had a
lot (\>50). Notice the message you get when creating this plot -
`stat_bin() using bins = 30. Pick better value with binwidth.` This means that
`ggplot()` chose a default width for the "bins" (rectangles) it creates on the
histogram, but that you can overwrite it if you want with the `binwidth`
argument. `ggplot()` will often do a good job, but you can choose one that best
fits your data.

```{r}
# very small binwidth
cups |>
  filter(year > 1950) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = shots_on_goal)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

```{r}
# very large binwidth - not as informative!
cups |>
  filter(year > 1950) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = shots_on_goal)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 25)
```

## Exercises #2

1.  Read in the `elections` data from the previous notebook. Then, create a
    histogram to visualize Democratic performance in all elections since and
    including 1992 (`>= 1992`) with one plot for each region.

For an extra challenge, try adding a vertical line to the plot at 50 with the
`geom_vline()` function (you can read the documentation for a function with
`?geom_vline` or by Googling "R `geom_vline()`, then scroll down to "Examples"
to see code examples using the function).

Finally, explain the general trend that you see.

```{r}
elections <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/lhp9nets5qb2rhe/presidential_elections.csv?dl=1")
```

2.  Using **only results from states in the South**, create a histogram for
    `democrat` with one plot per year. Try adding a vertical line at 50 as
    described above.

```{r}
# Write your code here.
```

Here, in text desrcibe the trend you see over time!

3.  Think about the trend you saw in Question 2. Clearly describe it. Discuss a
    way you might visualize that trend. If you have time, try designing a plot
    to do so.
